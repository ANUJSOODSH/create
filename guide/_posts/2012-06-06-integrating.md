In nutshell, you have to do the following:

* Annotate your content with RDFa
* Include the Create dependencies (jQuery, jQuery UI, Underscore, Backbone, VIE, the editor of your choice)
* Include the Create JavaScript file (see `examples/create.js` and `examples/create-min.js`)
* Implement [Backbone.sync](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/#Sync) for your back-end

[Blogsiple](https://github.com/bergie/blogsiple) is a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) based CMS integration testbed for Create. It may provide useful examples on how the connection between Create and a REST-capable web tool works.
