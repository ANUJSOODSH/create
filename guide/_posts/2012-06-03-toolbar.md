The `Midgard.midgardToolbar` widget provides the floating toolbar where various Create.js widgets place their buttons.

The toolbar can rendered full, or in a minimized mode where only the logo is shown. The minimized mode also triggers Create's _focus mode_ where the other UI elements are also shown in a minimalistic fashion, allowing authors to focus on the content they're writing.

When the [Create](#create) widget is used the toolbar will be instantiated automatically. If you want to use it standalone, then call it in the following way:

    jQuery('body').midgardToolbar({
      display: 'full'
    });

## Tool areas

The toolbar provides several different areas where buttons can be placed.

* **Session status**: Used for actions that affect the current usage session, like _Edit_ and _Save_. This area is identified by the CSS selector `.create-ui-toolbar-wrapper .create-ui-statustools`

## Configuration

* `display`: The display status of the toolbar, either `full` or `minimized`

## Events

* `midgardtoolbarstatechange`: when user opens or minimizes the toolbar. Event data contains an object with key `display` telling the new state
