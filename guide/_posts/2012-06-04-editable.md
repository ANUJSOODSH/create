The `Midgard.midgardEditable` widget is responsible for loading widgets (for example, the [Hallo](http://hallojs.org) rich text editor) for editing various content elements, and synchronizing those with the underlying [VIE](http://viejs.org) entity instances.

Create.js will load the Editable widget automatically for all RDFa annotated entities on the page, but you can also do it manually:

    jQuery('[about]').midgardEditable({
      vie: new VIE()
    });

## Configuration

* `widgets`: object telling which editor widget to load for which content type
* `collectionWidgets`: object telling which collection handling widget to load for which content type
