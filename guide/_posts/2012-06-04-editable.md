The `Midgard.midgardEditable` widget is responsible for loading widgets (for example, the [Hallo](http://hallojs.org) rich text editor) for editing various content elements, and synchronizing those with the underlying [VIE](http://viejs.org) entity instances.

Create.js will load the Editable widget automatically for all RDFa annotated entities on the page, but you can also do it manually:

    jQuery('[about]').midgardEditable({
      vie: new VIE()
    });

## Configuration

* `widgets`: object telling which editor widget to load for which content type
* `collectionWidgets`: object telling which collection handling widget to load for which content type

## States

The editable widget carries an editable entity through various different states and controls the behavior of the particular editor widgets as needed. There are various events signaling transitions between different states.

* _Inactive_ - editable has been loaded but editor is not active. Entered via the `midgardeditabledisable` event
* _Candidate_ - editor has been enabled for the editable. Entered via the `midgardeditableenable` and `midgardeditablenableproperty` events
* _Highlighted_ - user's mouse is over an editor but the editor hasn't been focused yet. Entered via the `midgardeditablehighlight` event
* _Active_ - editor is focused. Entered via `midgardeditableactivated` and exited via `midgardeditabledeactivated`
* _Modified_ - contents of the editor have been modified. Entered via `midgardeditablechanged` event
* _Invalid_ - contents of the editor have validation error(s)

## Events

* `midgardeditableenable`: when an object has been made editable. Event data contains an object with key `instance` providing the Backbone model instance and `entityElement` providing the element containing the object
* `midgardeditabledisable`: when an object has been made non-editable. Event data contains an object with key `instance` providing the Backbone model instance and `entityElement` providing the element containing the object
* `midgardeditableactivated`: when a particular property of an object has been activated in an editor. Event data contains keys `property`, `instance`, `element` and `entityElement`
* `midgardeditabledeactivated`: when a particular property of an object has been deactivated in an editor. Event data contains keys `property`, `instance`, `element` and `entityElement`
* `midgardeditablechanged`: when a particular property of an object has been changed in an editor. Event data contains keys `property`, `instance`, `element` and `entityElement`
* `midgardeditableenableproperty`: when an particular property of an object has been made editable. Event data contains keys

  * `property` (string),
  * `instance` (object),
  * `entityElement` (array)
  * `element` (array)
  * `editable` (array)

Because of a limitation of jQuery UI, please note that this event can be trigger by the widget only. So, with this HTML structure:

    <article about="/my/article" typeof="sioc:Post">
        <header>
            <h1 property="title">A title</h1>
        </header>
        <div class="content" property="content">
            Some content
        </div>
    </article>

    // this work
    jQuery('body article').bind('midgardeditableenableproperty',
        function(event, data) {
            console.log('i am called')
        }
    );

    // this doesn't work
    jQuery('body article .content').bind('midgardeditableenableproperty',
        function(event, data) {
            console.log('i am called');
        }
    );
