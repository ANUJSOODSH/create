The `Midgard.midgardStorage` widget keeps track of content items edited using the [Editable widget](#editable), and provides saving and loading functionality via both localStorage (for unsaved drafts) and the CMS back-end.

The Storage widget will be automatically instatiated by Create.js, but if you want to use it standalone, you can also:

    jQuery('body').midgardStorage({
      vie: new VIE(),
      url: function (item) { return '/some/url'; }
    });

## Configuration

* `localStorage`: Whether to enable localStorage. The Storage widget will automatically use Modernizr to probe whether browser has support for it and enable it accordingly
* `vie`: [VIE](http://viejs.org) instance to be used for content items
* `url`: The URL callback function used with Backbone.sync
* `autoSave`: Whether autosaving is enabled. `false` by default
* `autoSaveInterval`: autosaving interval, in milliseconds

## Events

* `midgardstorageloaded`: when an item has been restored from localStorage
* `midgardstoragesave`: when save to back-end has been initiated. Event data contains models key with all the changed entities
* `midgardstoragesaved`: when save has completed succesfully
